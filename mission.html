      Globalism (n) - ideology based on the belief that people, information, and goods should be able to cross national borders unrestricted.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Globalize Global was founded by Zeke Moroze in 2020. Globalize practices ethical printing, ships in boxes made with recycled materials, and 5% of each purchase is donated to carbon removal initiatives.

    <p>
      Globalize is for those who want to make a difference, for those who believe in love over the arbitrary borders of hate. It stands for unity, compassion, and creativity across the globe.
